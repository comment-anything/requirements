The functionality of Comment Anywhere is enabled through the storing and serving of data primarily originating from Users. Users submit data through forms, such as when they register an account or submit a comment. Comments and Accounts are stored in our Database. User login requests and Viewer requests to see comments require data sourced from that database. Additional data will be stored, including a record of moderation actions, removed comments, and metrics on usage. To retrieve comments for a specific webpage, the Browser Extension must also provide the Server with a datum of what webpage the user is currently viewing and wants comments for. A datum called a Token will also be provided by the server when a user logs in and at other times, and stored in the Front End, to enable the user to stay logged in by providing that token.
