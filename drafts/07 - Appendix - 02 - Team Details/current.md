This document was created by the team. We met several times in the Student Center to consult with each other as we worked. We utilized Discord to communicate and GitHub to manage project iterations.

Specific contributions are as follows.

Karl Miller created the project GitHub repository and wrote a python merge script to merge content and references from subfolders into a single large draft. He wrote the initial Abstract, Objective, Team Details & Dynamics, Operating Environment, Documentation, Testing Revisions, and Functional Requirements sections. He edited the Description of Data Sources and Nonfunctional Requirements.

Luke Bates designed and described the use case diagrams. He also added necessary terms to the appendix.
