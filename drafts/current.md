## Team Details & Dynamics

Communication, Organization, and Commitment are the tools we need to complete this project.

Discussions will be conducted in the project's Discord server. Additionally, Discord Webhooks will provide notifications whenever work is done on the source code.

Effective organization will be achieved using prevailing software management tools. Git can track versions and handle changes merged from multiple branches. GitHub provides access to a strong Issue system which we will use to communicate about project needs. 

Each group member has committed to being team leader for a phase of the project. That team leader will create the repository on our GitHub Organization's GitHub page and will communicate with the group to encourage all members to contribute to the project.



# Application Domain

The application domain of Comment Anywhere is internet communication services. More specifically, the domain is internet users commenting and viewing comments about web pages.  [1] 
# Initial Business Model


## Operating Environment

The Front Ends will run in the browser engines of Chrome, Firefox, and other browsers that may support Chromium or Firefox based extensions. The Back End and Database will be configured to run in one or more Virtual Machines to allow for simple deployment on a variety of cloud options.

## Documentation


Many types of documentation will be created throughout the project's lifestyle in order to produce a highly maintenable and extensible product that can adapt and scale after release. The target of the documentation is current and future developers. End users will require little documentation to interact with the product. Documentation for the developers will consist documentation generated from code comments and some additional hand written files. 

Some of the documentation files that will be created include: 

- A document entitled Testing.md will describe a standardized way to write and categorize unit tests and provide instructions for running and writing them.

- A document entited Versioning.md will describe the use of `git`.

- A document entitled Documenting.md will describe code-commenting practices. It will describe the procedure for generating project documentation from comments and adding additional non-generated documentation to that.

- A document entitled Glossary.md wil comprise a list of all nonstandard words used. It will be divided into application domain terms and terms specific to this project. It will also have a section describing the contents of each source code folder and a section describing the purpose of each file in root.

- A document entitled Build.md will provide instructions for building and running the project.

- A document entitled Database.md will describe database migrations.

- We will maintain 95% coverage with unit tests of source code we write.

- The writing center will review this project report.
