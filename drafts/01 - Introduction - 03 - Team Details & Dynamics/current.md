Communication, Organization, and Commitment are the tools we need to complete this project.

Discussions will be conducted in the project's Discord server. Additionally, Discord Webhooks will provide notifications whenever work is done on the source code.

Effective organization will be achieved using prevailing software management tools. Git can track versions and handle changes merged from multiple branches. GitHub provides access to a strong Issue system which we will use to communicate about project needs. 

Each group member has committed to being team leader for a phase of the project. That team leader will create the repository on our GitHub Organization's GitHub page and will communicate with the group to encourage all members to contribute to the project.
