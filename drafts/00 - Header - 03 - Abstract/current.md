We describe the results of Software Requirement Engineering in a Waterfall model as applied to our proposed Software Product, Comment Anywhere, a browser extension for commenting on webpages. In this document, the requirements of the product are developed. We begin by addressing the background, objective, and team details. We then explore the Application Domain, Operating Requirements, and describe Data Sources and Use Cases. Finally, we explicate the functional, nonfunctional, and documentary requirements of Comment Anywhere.
