The objective of this project is to create a web based browser extention to allow people to comment on websites based on their url. This is useful for websites that dont have comment sections or that are intentionally  misleading for people to make their own opinions out of without the pages author having a say. We will also have a automatic antimation system for spam comments and comments to harmful websites as well as a volentary moderation team to moderate these comments Wich will have a special ui for themselves as well for any administrators for the reporting and removing process of these comments and users. We hope to create a product that is able to hit the market and become the new way to comment on the internet free from those that want to stop the free flow of information.

This Product serves not only the end user, but the Proprietors of Comment Anywhere. Those individuals, who effectively contracted us to create this product, are a team of student developers looking to launch a startup. 

Their business plan is part of a four phase roll out. This product needs to get the Comment Anywhere team to Phase 1 of their roll out, but also needs to set them up for Phase 2. 

A brief summary of those phases is as follows:

**Phase 1: Initial Rollout**

    - Less than 50,000 monthly users
    - Goal is to garner interest and goodwill
    - Engage with users, listen to feedback, implement feature requests

**Phase 2: "Buy Me a Coffee"**

    - Less than 200,000 monthly users
    - Continue to build interest and goodwill
    - Capitalize on good will to offset costs

**Phase 3: Good Place to Advertise**

    - Roll out ad purchasing system
    - Intersperse ads with comments on relevant content like other companies do with search engines and other comment pages.
    - Scale


Targeting Phase 1 influences functional and nonfunctional requirements around maintenability, scalability, and deployability. The Comment Anywhere team will have to be able to scale and continue to add features and develop this product while keeping costs as low as possible. They must have the core of a good database and moderation interface that they can improve upon as the product continues to develop.
