The objective of this project is to create a web based browser extention which allows people to comment on websites based on their url. This is useful for websites that dont have comment sections, especially when viewers have additional thoughts or information to offer. We will have typical features of commenting systems, including reporting, automated moderation, manual moderation, and account control and additional unique features. Our aim is to launch the product as a profitable business, and the goal of this project is to meet Phase 1 of our business plan.

** Phase 1: Initial Rollout** 
 - Less than 50,000 monthly users
 - Goal is to garner interest and goodwill
 - Engage with users, listen to feedback, implement feature requests

** Phase 2: "Buy Me a Coffee"**
 - Less than 200,000 monthl users
 - Continue to build interest and goodwill

** Phase 3: "Good Place to Advertise"**

We hope to create a product that is able to hit the market and become the new way to comment on the internet free from those that seek to stop the free flow of information.
