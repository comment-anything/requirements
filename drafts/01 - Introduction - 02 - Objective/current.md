The objective of this project is to create a web based browser extention to allow people to comment on websites based on their url. This is useful for websites that dont have comment sections or that are intentionally  misleading for people to make their own opinions out of without the pages author having a say. We will also have a automatic antimation system for spam comments and comments to harmful websites as well as a volentary moderation team to moderate these comments Wich will have a special ui for themselves as well for any administrators for the reporting and removing process of these comments and users. We hope to create a product that is able to hit the market and become the new way to comment on the internet free from those that want to stop the free flow of information.
