- Memory and Bandwidth Usage

    The Server and Database must be optimized to minimize Memory and Bandwidth Usage as much as possible. We will likely be paying for cloud hosting and have no source of income throughout the Phase 1 roll out. Therefore, we will need to optimize our Server to keep our costs as low as possible so we can afford to make it to phase 2. To that end, we must implement caching and cache clearing, low cost threads, and offloading as much processing to the Front End as possible.

- Documentation

    After this initial roll out, we will be in Phase 1 of our Business Plan. During that Phase, we will continue to add features as we build a User Base. Effective code documentation is necessary to enable easily adding new features to Comment Anywhere.

- Password security

    We need to keep the passwords of our user's secure. We can do this by encrypting the users passwords before storage. Passwords will only be stored in their encrypted state and we will not have access to them. 

- Username Policy

    We need to have a username policy that describes which types of Usernames are prohibited.

- Comment Policy

    We need a Comment policy which describes which sorts of comments are prohibited or otherwise regulated. Our policy must be strict enough to comply with U.S. Law, but not so strict as to alienate our target user base, who prefer freer speech when possible.

- Back Ups

    Our system must be prepared for failures. We will need to create regular backups of our database so we can restore from past points without losing too much data when the system goes down.

- General security

    We will need to take some steps to make the application secure. Generally, most security improvements will be saved until after the initial roll out but some things, such as basic SQL injection prevention and password encyption should be implemented by the initial roll out.

- Appealing User Interface

    Our user interface will need to be user friendly or else users will just not use the product. We will attempt to create a pleasing to the eye graphical user interface (gui).

- Deployability

    Our build and deployment setup needs to be flexible enough to change hosting providers as our needs evolve. We can set up our build chain to use Containers, such as through Docker, allowing us to deploy our Product on a variety of cloud platforms, or through self-hosting. 

- Legality

    Our Program will have to be compliant with United States law. It must have a Privacy Policy and a Terms and Conditions that all Users agree to, to help mitigate lawsuits and other possible legal actions.
