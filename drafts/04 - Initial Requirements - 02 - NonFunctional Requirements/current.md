- User Capacity

    We need to keep a low number of Users in our database so that we dont run out of space, After a select period of time we will log out the user's from the list of active users. A logged out user becomes a viewer no matter their rank and will have to log back in again to add themselves back to the database and become a user again.

- Password security
    We will also need to keep the passwords of our user's secure, we can do this by encrypting the users passwords and saving that to the spacific user. When a user wants to log on again and sign in with their password we will compare the encryption of the password to the encrypted password attached to the user and if the 2 encryptions match the user will be logged in.

- Username Blacklist
    There are some usernames that we need to blacklist from becoming users. when a user first creates their username or changes it we will be checked against a list of blacklisted words and if the username is blacklisted the name will not be made or changed.

- General security
    Our systems will need to have a general layer of security to our extention. We will create backups of our databases incase our security is breached.

- Appealing User Interface
    Our user interface will need to be user friendly or else users will just not use the product. We will attempt to create a pleasing to the eye graphical user interface (gui) for every type of user. The viewers that only displays comments, users that can also comment themselves, local moderators that report user comments, global moderators that can appoint and remove local moderators and admins that can also appoint and remove global moderators.

- Deployability
    We will need to use various programs and programming languages in order to create comment anything. we will need to use resources such as  Docker and cloud hosting services to make a complete product.

- Legality
    Our Program will have to be complient with united states standard law's. Weather that be in covering hate speech or protecting free speech or some arbitrary requirement for the product.
