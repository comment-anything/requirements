Many types of documentation will be created throughout the project's lifecycle in order to produce a highly maintenable and extensible product that can adapt and scale after release. The target of the documentation is current and future developers. End users will require little documentation to interact with the product. Documentation for the developers will consist documentation generated from code comments and some additional hand written files. 

The standard engineering documentats that will be created are: 

1. Proposal Document

The initial document describing the intent of the project.

2. Requirements Document

This document; used to describe the basic needs of development.

3. Specifications Document

....

4. Design Document

....

Additionally, we will create some extra documentation to enable continued Phase 1 development.

1. Testing.md

Will describe a standardized way to write and categorize unit tests and provide instructions for running and writing them.

2. Versioning.md

Will describe the use of `git`, `github` and any commit message policies we may implement.

3. Documenting.md

Describes code-commenting practices. It will describe the procedure for generating project documentation from comments and adding additional non-generated documentation to that.

4. Glossary.md

A list of all nonstandard words used. It will be divided into application domain terms and terms specific to this project. It will also have a section describing the contents of each source code folder and a section describing the purpose of each file in root.

5. Build.md

Will provide instructions for building and running the project. 

6. Database.md

Will describe database migration and backup procedures.
