This document underwent several phases of testing. The first phase was unit testing during development, when the document was broken into portions for each section. Each unit consisted of a section's content, associated terms, and references. Every team member reviewed each section in isolation many times and improved on the content, references and glossary before the document was combined into an initial rough draft. 

The rough draft was continuously integration tested by running a merge script which assembled a markdown file by combining the text, term, and reference components. The document was evaluated as a whole and improvements were made on component sections to optimize their performance in the rough draft. 

After a satisfactory rough draft was produced, the markdown document was copied into Word for quality assurance. Every team member participated in spellchecking, formatting, and adding some additional content in the final word document. 

Finally, we simulated an acceptance test by taking the document to the Writing Center for review. We made some minor revisions in response to test results.
