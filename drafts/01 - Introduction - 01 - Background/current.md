Internet denizens have long found ways to have vibrant communications about a wide variety of content. In the past, more website supported these conversations through comment sections, but many have closed their comments in recent years.[1] Instead, the avenues of discourse have become social media sites such as Facebook, Reddit, and bulletin board style forums, decoupling the conversation from the content itself.

Tying comments to social media posts rather than the content has the effect of fragmenting the conversation and diluting information available to viewers. Evidence exists that users spend less time on webpages without comments and report a worse user experience. [2] 

We infer that there is a market for comments tied to content rather than posts and an application that can bring comments to the content could capture monetizable user engagement.
