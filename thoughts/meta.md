# Concerning the Requirements Process

I will be updating this folder with my thoughts and some questions to answer.

## My Absence

I would like to again apologize for my delays and absence. I realize it has been frustrating and unfair to the team as a whole, and expect your reports to indicate that. It's my responsibility to be an active team member, and I've failed thus far. I simply ask for your understand while I've been dealing with some very personal issues. It is my intent to be much more active going forward.

## Format

Dr. Chen specified in our last submission he would like a Microsoft Word document submitted for easier commenting. LaTeX to Word conversion is kind of iffy at times, so it likely behooves us to piece together the final product in Word or Google Docs, the latter being much easier to collaborate. I myself would've preferred the LaTeX workflow, but it is what it is.

As such, I do like the idea of creating different pieces for everything and trying to write a script that will compile it all at the end. I'd perhaps simply be cautious as we need to convert it into a Word doc at the end, which will still likely result in some manual editting of bits even if we can automate the majority of the conversion.
