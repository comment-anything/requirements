# Introduction

In order to address the requirements from a broader business perspective, I suggest that we incorporate a vague business plan into our thoughts about requirements. If we view this as contract software to get Comment Anywhere LLC to Phase 1 of its rollout, we can address business requirements than are broader than just 'does the extension function'. 

It's a little tongue-in-cheek in that I treat the Proprietors of Comment Anywhere as a separate entity from the developers when obviously we are the same people.


# Business Plan



This Product serves not only the end user, but the Proprietors of Comment Anywhere. Those individuals, who effectively contracted us to create this product, are a team of student developers looking to launch a startup. 

Their business plan is part of a four phase roll out. This product needs to get the Comment Anywhere team to Phase 1 of their roll out, but also needs to set them up for Phase 2. 

A brief summary of those phases is as follows:

**Phase 1: Initial Rollout**

    - Less than 50,000 monthly users
    - Goal is to garner interest and goodwill
    - Engage with users, listen to feedback, implement feature requests

**Phase 2: "Buy Me a Coffee"**

    - Less than 200,000 monthly users
    - Continue to build interest and goodwill
    - Capitalize on good will to offset costs

**Phase 3: Good Place to Advertise**

    - Roll out ad purchasing system
    - Intersperse ads with comments on relevant content like other companies do with search engines and other comment pages.
    - Scale


Targeting Phase 1 influences functional and nonfunctional requirements around maintenability, scalability, and deployability. The Comment Anywhere team will have to be able to scale and continue to add features and develop this product while keeping costs as low as possible. They must have the core of a good database and moderation interface that they can improve upon as the product continues to develop.
