# KLM View On Moderation


## Introduction

I was originally going to create an issue on GitHub, but I don't think Moderation _quite_ calls for that yet. Reason being that in Requirements, Moderation is just one of a number of nonfunctional requirements to be described, but not fleshed out in detail. 

However it has been brought up and I do think how the platform is moderated will influence how we each feel about working on the platform. So I want to share my thoughts on it.

## Target Audience

Who is our market? If we are following the business plan model, who are those first 100,000 users who will "buy us a coffee"? 

They will need to be enthusiasts who are willing to put up with a low-traffic platform because they believe in its mission. 

I don't think we will find such enthusiasts for a high-moderation platform that removes anything designated as politically incorrect. We are more likely to find our first-mover users amongst those disenfranchised by the current comment systems and who crave the free speech of the "old" internet. Those who want the former are unlikely to move away from Reddit and other platforms that already largely serve their needs.

## Brand 

Moderation Policy can be part of our **Brand**. We should advertise it. And I think that the message should akin to:

> We are a platform of Free Speech where some stuff that people don't want said gets said, and we allow it when it isn't utterly obscene or actually illegal.

## Initial Thoughts

- Nothing Illegal in the USA (e.g. Calls to Violence)

- No Spam (What defines spam?)

- No racial slurs

- No links to pornography

- No excessively lewd descriptions? (e.g., someone posting erotica) No excessive cursing?

In general, less is more. 

## Examples of stuff that gets removed

> Go to hell you f**ing ********* !

> Check out pornhub.com for sexy singles in your area!

> free money at w.w.co free money at w.w.co free money at w.w.co!

> The people should rise up, lets all attack the Harrisburg with our rifles on 5th November!

## Examples of stuff that doesnt get removed that would get removed on other platforms

> Over 31,000 deaths have been reported to VAERS - the vaccine is ineffective and dangerous!

> Trans women are dangerous to real women, see Dana Rivers!

> 911 was an inside job!

## Another Brand Possibility

> "We are a platform of free and _polite_ speech, where free expression of ideas and controversial opinions are allowed, but we are the Gestapo about polite phrasing. Find nice ways to express your meannest thoughts and you will find a home here."
