This repository is for creating the Requirements document.

It is due October 17th and we have to finish early enough to get into the writing center.

Inside drafts is a folder for each section of the requirements document.

Inside each folder will be the files `current.md` and `terms.txt`

`current.md` is the contents of that section. `terms.txt` is a list of glossary words and references for them.

I intend to write a script to create a single file out of every `current.md` and assemble the glossary and references from the `terms.txt`, once more draft work has been done.
