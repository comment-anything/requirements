This repository is for creating the Requirements document.

It is due October 17th and we have to finish early enough to get into the writing center.

Inside drafts is a folder for each section of the requirements document.

Inside each folder will be the files `current.md` and `terms.txt`

`current.md` is the contents of that section. `terms.txt` is a list of glossary words and references for them.

I intend to write a script to create a single file out of every `current.md` and assemble the glossary and references from the `terms.txt`, once more draft work has been done.




## Feel free to edit and pull request any current.md file in any sections subfolder under drafts.

### If you would rather start another / different draft version we can figure out how to combine them later. Just do it in another directory of this repo. 

I haven't tried this way of making a big document like this before. But I think it will be straightforward to convert it to Latex or anything else, and be easy to edit. 

I also hope to merge the terms.txt from each subfolder to generate the appropriate list and glossary.
